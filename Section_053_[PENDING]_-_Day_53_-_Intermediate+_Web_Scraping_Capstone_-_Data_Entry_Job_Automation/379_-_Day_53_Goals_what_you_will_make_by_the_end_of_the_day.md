### Why This Stands Out

Weather data is high-frequency, quantitative, structured, and ideal for time-series modeling. It supports forecasting, anomaly detection, and visualization projects.

### Data Quality Characteristics

| Attribute               | Value    |
| ----------------------- | -------- |
| Structure Consistency   | High     |
| Update Frequency        | Daily    |
| Legal Risk              | Very Low |
| Authentication Required | No       |

### What You Can Build

* Historical temperature database.
* Rainfall anomaly detection model.
* Seasonal trend visualizations.
* Automated weekly climate summary report.

### Technical Depth

* Table scraping with Selenium.
* Time-series storage in SQLite or PostgreSQL.
* Data cleaning and unit normalization.
* Automated scheduler integration.

## Strategic Recommendation

If your objective is portfolio strength plus realistic engineering depth:

1. **Press Information Bureau pipeline** for NLP + policy analytics.
2. **National Career Service analyzer** for structured database design.
3. **Weather collector** for time-series modeling.
4. **University notice monitor** for automation + file management workflow.

These four are publicly accessible, legally safe when scraped responsibly, technically substantial, and demonstrate serious engineering capability without triggering bot-defense systems.
