### Why This Stands Out

Academic portals publish structured circulars, results, recruitment notices, and exam updates. This creates a realistic production-level monitoring system use case.

### Data Quality Characteristics

| Attribute               | Value            |
| ----------------------- | ---------------- |
| Structure Consistency   | Moderate to High |
| Update Frequency        | Weekly / Monthly |
| Legal Risk              | Very Low         |
| Authentication Required | No (for notices) |

### What You Can Build

* Automated PDF archive system.
* Notification bot for new results.
* Trend analysis of recruitment frequency.
* Deadline reminder automation tool.

### Technical Depth

* PDF auto-download configuration.
* File renaming standardization.
* Content hash comparison to prevent duplicates.
* Logging and failure recovery mechanisms.
