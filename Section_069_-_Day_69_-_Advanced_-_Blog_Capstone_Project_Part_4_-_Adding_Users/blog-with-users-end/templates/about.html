          organizing projects with sensible file structures, and creating efficient workflows 
          that solve real‑world problems.

          Outside of coding, I’ve worked as a Crew Member at McDonald’s (which taught me teamwork 
          and handling high‑pressure situations) and as a freelance Music Producer & Sound Engineer, 
          where I honed project management, client relations, and deadline discipline.
